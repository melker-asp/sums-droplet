# Sums, a Droplet for Droppy

<!-- Written by `droppykit agent`. Add your own notes below; the file is only rewritten with --force. -->

This package is a **Droplet**: an extension that runs inside Droppy, the
Dynamic Island and shelf for Mac, written in SwiftUI against **DroppyKit**.
Droppy loads the built `.droplet` bundle into its own process and draws it on
the notch, the shelf, the lock screen and the menu bar.

- Droplet id: `sums`. It is also `SumsDroplet.id` in Swift and `id` in `droplet.json`; the three must agree or the loader refuses the bundle.
- Swift product: `Sums`, a dynamic library. The harness target is `SumsHarness`.
- SDK checkout: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit` (DroppyKit 1.7.0). Docs online: https://getdroppy.app/docs/droppykit
- Host: Droppy 15.3 or later, or the free Droppy Playground (https://getdroppy.app/download/playground), which loads unsigned bundles.

## The loop

Every change goes through all of this, in order. A droplet can compile,
validate and then draw nothing, so a green build is not the end.

1. Edit `Sources/Sums/`. The manifest is `droplet.json`.
2. `droppykit build` writes `.build/Sums.droplet`, universal, linked against the
   framework Droppy ships. Never a bare `swift build` for the bundle: it folds a second
   copy of DroppyKit into the droplet, and that bundle loads in the harness and dies
   inside Droppy at dyld with "Symbol not found".
3. `droppykit validate` runs the exact checks the Store's intake runs.
4. `droppykit run -- --shots ./shots --report ./shots/report.json` renders every surface
   to a PNG without opening a window and writes a JSON verdict. Look at the pictures.
   Read `report.json`: `problems` must be empty and every surface you declared must be
   `provided`.
5. Put the bundle into Droppy Playground and confirm it loaded. Copy
   `.build/Sums.droplet` to
   `~/Library/Application Support/Droppy Playground/Droplets/sums/Sums.droplet`,
   relaunch the Playground, and read its Store row: the subtitle is the loader's verdict.

With the DroppyKit MCP server connected, the same steps are the tools `droppykit_build`,
`droppykit_validate`, `droppykit_shots` and `droppykit_install`, and `droppykit_shots`
returns the images inline. This package carries the server in `.mcp.json` (Claude Code)
and `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor). Codex: `codex mcp add droppykit -- /Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Scripts/droppykit mcp`.
The other tools are `droppykit_manifest` (a static check, no build), `droppykit_docs`
(the guides and a search over the SDK sources), `droppykit_doctor`, `droppykit_new`,
`droppykit_open_harness` and `droppykit_submit`.

`droppykit run` with no arguments opens the harness window for a person: Droppy's own
Settings panel with a page per surface. You cannot see that window. The shots are your
eyes; take them after every visual change.

`droppykit version` says which SDK checkout the scripts come from and which tag this
package pins; `droppykit update` moves both to the newest release. A build that stops with
"no compiled objects" or "DroppyKit.o not found" is an SDK older than 1.2.1: update it.

## Rules

- **Surfaces and conformances agree.** `surfaces` in `droplet.json` lists what the droplet
  provides; the droplet conforms to the matching protocol for each of them and to nothing it
  does not list. Disagreement is the most common reason a droplet validates and then does
  nothing.
- **Every shelf widget declares both widths.** `preferredSoloWidth` and
  `preferredPairedWidth` are required; Droppy refuses a descriptor that leaves either to a
  host fallback. Solo and paired are different compositions, not one view at two widths:
  branch on `context.isPaired`.
- **Layout traits describe the widget's rectangle.** Every number in
  `ShelfWidgetLayoutTraits` is the area the widget draws in, in points at the Regular shelf
  size, exactly what the harness renders; Droppy adds its own chrome around it. `.fixed(150)`
  is a 150-point rectangle, alone and in a row, clamped to 48 through 480. A widget that needs
  more height declares more; it never pads its way out of a clip. A solo widget is never
  narrower than 352 on a notch or 370 on an island, so lay out to `context.availableSize`.
- **No card, no border around the widget.** Droppy paints nothing behind a widget and almost
  every one of its own widgets lays its content directly on the shelf's black. Put no
  background, fill, outline or rounded box on the widget's root view. `notchSurfaceCardFill`
  is for a tile or a chip inside the widget that has to read as raised, never a frame.
- **Lay the widget out like Droppy's.** The root view fills the rectangle
  (`.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)`) with ONE
  padding, `.padding(context.contentInsets)`, and nothing on top of it. That is the host's own
  inset for the slot and it is ZERO under a notch: the shelf's chrome already inset the
  rectangle, so padding again puts the widget lower and narrower than the built-in beside it.
  Leading text, trailing `.monospacedDigit()` numbers, rows that span the
  full width, a header row of a 12pt symbol and a 12pt semibold title with the widget's control
  at its trailing end, `DroppySpacing` steps between rows. Declare the height the content
  needs; never leave unused space or fill it with padding.
- **The physical notch is cleared for you, except on a HUD strip.** The shelf, a takeover,
  a HUD card and a live activity are inset past the camera housing by the host; never pad for
  it. A HUD strip is handed the whole width across the housing: put its content at the two
  outer edges and nothing in the middle (`host.environment.notchGeometry.closedWidth` is the
  housing), the way the World Clock example's strip does. Never centre a strip.
- **Buttons are Liquid Glass, Droppy's own.** `DroppyCircleButtonStyle` (20pt on an item,
  24pt in a row) for an icon action, `DroppyQuietButtonStyle` and `DroppyAccentButtonStyle`
  (`.small`) for labelled ones, `DroppyGlassButtonStyle` for a label with its own sizing.
  Never a flat wash, a bordered chip or a white button of your own. A list with a control per
  row wraps in `droppyFlatGlassControls()`. Only a live activity row's controls keep
  `DroppyLiveActivityControlStyle`.
- **Everything `activate(host:)` starts, `deactivate()` stops.** Timers, observers, tasks,
  connections. Swift cannot unload code, so anything left running runs until Droppy
  relaunches.
- **A widget the user watches holds the shelf open while it runs.** The shelf closes when the
  pointer leaves it; a teleprompter, countdown or live transcript calls
  `host.shelf.setHoldsOpen(true)` when its work starts and `false` the moment it ends
  (`shelf-write`, `minAPI` 1.5.0). A widget with nothing to show until it is configured sends
  the user to its settings pane with `host.workspace.openSettings()`, and asks for permissions
  there through `host.permissions`, never from the shelf.
- **Host calls are gated by `capabilities`.** A service call without its capability in
  `droplet.json` is refused: it returns `false` or `nil` and logs one line. Declare what you
  use and only that; the user sees the list.
- **The principal class does nothing.** `SumsPrincipal` is `@objc`, is named in the
  bundle's `NSPrincipalClass`, and only creates the droplet. It runs before the host is ready.
- **No `main.swift`.** The harness entry is `@main` in
  `Sources/SumsHarness/SumsHarness.swift`, and a file named `main.swift` cannot
  coexist with `@main`.
- **Look like Droppy, not like a guest.** Surfaces are dark. Foreground colours come from
  `AdaptiveColors`, spacing from `DroppySpacing`, radii from `DroppyRadius` with
  `style: .continuous`. No borders or outlines, no gradients, no ALL-CAPS labels, sentence
  case everywhere, and never paint your own background on a widget. Settings panes are built
  from `DropletSettingsCard`, `DropletControlRow`, `DropletToggleRow`, `DropletStackedRow`
  and `DropletSliderRow`.
- **`droplet.json` is the truth for the build.** `Info.plist` is generated from it.
  `version` is numeric `major.minor.patch`; `summary` is at most 60 characters;
  `minAppVersion` stays `15.3.0` unless the droplet needs something newer; `kit.minAPI` is
  the oldest DroppyKit API the droplet actually calls.
- **Do not edit anything under `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit`.** That is the SDK checkout; fixes there go
  upstream. This package is where the work is.

## Where the truth is

Read these before guessing at an API. They are on disk, in the SDK checkout.

  `LiveActivities.md`, `ExpandedSurfaces.md`, `SettingsPanes.md`, `Icons.md`, `Harness.md`,
  `HostSupport.md`, `Playground.md`, `Submitting.md`, and `BuildWithCodingAgents.md` for this
  workflow in full.
- The surface protocols, one file each: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Sources/DroppyKit/Capabilities/`
- The host services a droplet calls: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Sources/DroppyKit/Services/DropletServices.swift`
  and `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Sources/DroppyKit/Core/DropletHost.swift`
- The manifest type, with every field documented: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Sources/DroppyKit/Bundle/DropletManifest.swift`
- Design tokens and the settings components: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Sources/DroppyKit/DesignSystem/`
- A complete droplet that uses every surface: `/Users/melkerasp/dev/droppykit/Examples/WorldClock/`

## Surfaces

| `surfaces` value in droplet.json | Conform to | Shot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shelf-widget` | `ShelfWidgetProviding` | `shelf-widget.png` |
| `live-activity` | `LiveActivityProviding` | `live-activity.png` |
| `expanded-surface` | `ExpandedSurfaceProviding` | `expanded-surface.png` |
| `settings-pane` | `SettingsPaneProviding` | `settings-pane.png` |
| `hud` | `HUDPresenting` | `hud.png` |
| `lock-screen-status` | `LockScreenStatusProviding` | `lock-screen.png` |
| `menu-bar-extra` | `MenuBarExtraProviding` | `menu-bar.png` |

`overview.png` shows the identity card with a verdict pill per surface, `capabilities.png`
the capability switches, `preferences.png` every stored value, and `activity.png` every host
call in order, refused ones marked.

## Done means

- `droppykit build` and `droppykit validate` both pass.
- The report's `problems` is empty and `activation.error` is null.
- You have looked at the shot of every surface you touched.
- The bundle loaded in Droppy Playground: `droppykit_install` says loaded, or the Store row
  shows it switched on.
- `droplet.json` still describes what the code does: surfaces, capabilities, summary.

## Package layout

```
Package.swift                     product Sums (dynamic) and SumsHarness
droplet.json                      the manifest; Info.plist is generated from it
Sources/Sums/              the droplet
Sources/SumsHarness/       the @main harness entry; never main.swift
Sums.icon/                 Icon Composer document, required
Assets/Creator.png                square creator avatar, at least 256px, required
.build/Sums.droplet        what droppykit build writes
AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursor/    this brief and the agent wiring
.mcp.json, .cursor/mcp.json       the DroppyKit MCP server; absolute paths for this Mac
```

## Submitting

Droppy itself only loads droplets the Store review signed, which is why the Playground
exists. When the droplet is done: replace the placeholder icon and creator avatar, fill in
`creator` and `source` in `droplet.json`, push the repository, and run `droppykit submit`. It
opens getdroppy.app/submit-droplet with the repository, commit and id filled in.

## Sums notes

- **Build with `./Scripts/build-droplet.sh`, not `droppykit build` or `droppykit_build`.**
  Sums links SoulverCore, a closed-source dynamic xcframework. The script is the SDK's
  build script with changes marked `SUMS:`: it links SoulverCore and embeds it in
  `Contents/Frameworks`. The SDK's own build stops at link time with undefined symbols.
  `droppykit validate`, `run -- --shots` and installing into Playground work as usual.
- **Tests:** `swift test`. They cover the engine (totals, statistics, `prev`, inputs,
  copies as plain numbers), every template, Markdown masking, export and the store.
- **Engine:** `SheetEngine` wraps SoulverCore's `LineCollection`. SoulverCore has no
  words for "the lines above", so `Aggregate` lines (`total`, `average`, `std dev`…)
  and `prev` are filled in after a first pass with `setExpression` and evaluated again.
  `MarkdownMask` blanks list markers, code and tables before SoulverCore sees a sheet.
- **Number format decides parsing, not just display:** `8 500` is 8500 only when a space
  groups thousands. Templates are written Swedish-style and converted on creation.
- **Editor layout:** `SumsTextView` reacts to width changes only, and never reassigns
  identical exclusion paths; `CalculatorEditor.sizeThatFits` fills its proposal. Either
  mistake starts a layout loop that pins a core (the harness hangs on `--shots`).
- **Licensing:** SoulverCore is free for personal use. Publishing needs Soulver's
  licence (they offer a free one with attribution); ask them before submitting.
